abstract: Algorithms for causal discovery have recently undergone rapid advances and
  increasingly draw on flexible nonparametric methods to process complex data. With
  these advances comes a need for adequate empirical validation of the causal relationships
  learned by different algorithms. However, for most real and complex data sources
  true causal relations remain unknown. This issue is further compounded by privacy
  concerns surrounding the release of suitable high-quality data. To tackle these
  challenges, we introduce $\texttt{causalAssembly}$, a semisynthetic data generator
  designed to facilitate the benchmarking of causal discovery methods. The tool is
  built using a complex real-world dataset comprised of measurements collected along
  an assembly line in a manufacturing setting. For these measurements, we establish
  a partial set of ground truth causal relationships through a detailed study of the
  physics underlying the processes carried out in the assembly line. The partial ground
  truth is sufficiently informative to allow for estimation of a full causal graph
  by mere nonparametric regression. To overcome potential confounding and privacy
  concerns, we use distributional random forests to estimate and represent conditional
  distributions implied by the ground truth causal graph. These conditionals are combined
  into a joint distribution that strictly adheres to a causal model over the observed
  variables. Sampling from this distribution, $\texttt{causalAssembly}$ generates
  data that are guaranteed to be Markovian with respect to the ground truth. Using
  our tool, we showcase how to benchmark several well-known causal discovery algorithms.
